When shrinkage porosity is controlled, the relevant microstructural initiation sites are often the larger Si particles within eutectic regions. In this paper, a HCF model is introduced which recognizes multiple inclusion severity scales for crack formation. The model addresses the role of constrained microplasticity around debonded particles or shrinkage pores in forming and growing microstructurally small fatigue cracks and is based on the cyclic crack tip displacement rather than linear elastic fracture mechanics stress intensity factor.

Modeling of processes of early stages of fatigue crack nucleation and growth at these microstructure scales is an important emerging frontier in several respects. First, it facilitates analysis of the influence of local microstructure attributes on the distribution of driving forces for fatigue crack formation as a function of the applied stress state. This can support microstructure-sensitive estimates of minimum life, as well as characterization of competing failure modes. Second, it can inform modification of process route and its manifestations (e.g., residual stress, texture) to alter microstructure in ways that promote enhanced resistance to formation of fatigue cracks. Third, microstructure-sensitive modeling, even conducted at the mesocopic scale of individual grains/phases, can facilitate parametric design exploration in searching for microstructure morphologies and/or compositions that modify fatigue resistance. Fourth, such technologies offer promise for integration with advanced nondestructive evaluation methods for prognosis and structural health monitoring. Finally, as a longer term prospect in view of uncertainties in modeling mechanisms of cyclic slip, crack nucleation and growth, such modeling can serve to support more quantitative predictions of fatigue lifetime as a function of microstructure. We first discuss computationally based microstructure-sensitive fatigue modeling in the context of recent initiatives in accelerated insertion of materials and integration of computational mechanics, materials science, and systems engineering in design of materials and structures. We then highlight recent application of such strategies to Ni-base superalloys, gear steels, and α–β Ti alloys, with focus on the individual grain scale as the minimum length scale of heterogeneity. Finally, we close by outlining opportunities to advance microstructure-sensitive fatigue modeling in the next decade.},

Multiscale approaches for modeling polycrystalline materials may significantly reduce the effort necessary for characterizing such material models experimentally, in particular when a large number of cycles is considered, as typical for fatigue applications. Even when appropriate microstructures and microscopic material models are identified, calibrating the individual parameters of the model to some experimental data is necessary for industrial use, and the task is formidable as even a single simulation run is time consuming (although less expensive than a corresponding experiment). For solving this problem, we investigate Gaussian process based Bayesian optimization, which iteratively builds up and improves a surrogate model of the objective function, at the same time accounting for uncertainties encountered during the optimization process. We describe the approach in detail, calibrating the material parameters of a high-strength steel as an application. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves upon comparable approaches based on an evolutionary algorithm and performing derivative-free methods.},

Additional cyclic hardening developed during out-of-phase loading is included in the normal stress term. Also, the mathematical formulation of this new parameter is such that variable amplitude loading can be accommodated. Experimental results from tubular specimens made of 1045 HR steel under in-phase and 90° out-of-phase axial-torsional straining using both sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave forms were correlated within a factor of about two employing this approach. Available Inconel 718 axial-torsional data including mean strain histories were also satisfactorily correlated using the aforementioned parameter.},

	abstract = {The fatigue life of a component can be expressed as the sum of two segments of life: (a) the number of loading cycles required to initiate a crack and (b) the number of cycles it takes that crack to propagate to failure. In this review, the primary emphasis is relating the fatigue crack initiation to the microstructure of the material. Many studies have focused on this phenomenon over the years and the goal of this paper is to put this work in perspective and encourage future work of fatigue in polycrystals based on the material’s microstructure. In order to address fatigue, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that facilitate crack initiation. Slip irreversibilities exist in a material and accumulate during fatigue loading. At the defect level, irreversibilities are a result of dislocations: annihilating, cross-slipping, penetrating precipitates, transmitting through grain boundaries, and piling-up. These slip irreversibilities are the early signs of damage during cyclic loading. The dislocations subsequently form low-energy, stable structures as a means to accommodate the irreversible slip processes and increasing dislocation density during cyclic forward and reverse loading. The result is strain localizing in a small region within the materials, i.e. persistent slip bands and dislocation cells/bundles. Strain localization is a precursor to crack initiation. This review paper will focus on experimental observations of strain localization and the theory and numerical analysis of both slip irreversibilities and low energy configuration defect structures. This fundamental understanding is necessary to study persistent slip bands in FCC metals and alloys including the appropriate characterization, theory, and modeling. From this fundamental knowledge both micromechanical and crystal plasticity models can be used to predict crack initiation, which are also reviewed. Finally, this review ends with a discussion of the future of fatigue modeling and experiments.},

In this work, we improve the state of the art solvers. For a given set of seeds and corresponding volume fractions summing to unity, there is a set of Laguerre weights such that the corresponding Laguerre tessellation realizes the prescribed volume fractions exactly. Furthermore, the Laguerre weights are unique up to a constant and can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem. However, whenever the optimization algorithm encounters a weight vector leading to an empty cell, the optimization problem is no longer locally strictly convex. To account for the latter, backtracking strategies are typically employed. We show that modern gradient-based optimization algorithms devoid of backtracking, like the Malitsky–Mishchenko method and the Barzilai–Borwein scheme easily overcome the described difficulty, leading to a significant speed-up compared to more traditional solvers. Furthermore, for computing centroidal Laguerre tessellations of prescribed volume fraction, we propose an Anderson-accelerated version of Lloyd’s algorithm, and show, by numerical experiments, that it consistently reduces the run-time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methods for generating microstructures of polycrystalline materials with prescribed grain size distribution.},

By leveraging the ability of the FFT-based solver to generate solutions with higher-order and global continuities, we design two simple algorithms to capture the complex fracture patterns (e.g. sawtooth, and curved crack growth) common in materials with strongly anisotropic surface energy via the multi-phase-field and high-order phase-field frameworks. A staggered operator-split solver is used where both the balance of linear momentum and the phase field governing equations are formulated in the periodic domain. The unit phase field of the initial failure region is prescribed by the penalty method to alleviate the sharp material contrast between the initial failure region and the base material. The discrete frequency vectors are generalized to estimate the second and fourth order gradients such that the Gibbs effect near shape interfaces or jump conditions can be suppressed. Furthermore, a preconditioner is adopted to improve the convergence rate of the iterative linear solver. Three numerical experiments are used to systematically compare the performance of the FFT-based method in the multi-phase-field and high-order phase-field frameworks.},

	abstract = {Composite materials possess a highly complex material behavior, and thus advanced simulation techniques are necessary to compute their mechanical response. In this regard, especially modeling failure and progressive damage presents a challenging task. Conventional macro mechanical methods and even closed form estimates are in many cases not sufficient to predict the appropriate mechanical material response. Full-field simulations must be resorted to, but these are known to be very expensive from the computational point of view. In this contribution we propose a more efficient multiscale approach similar to FE2. Nonlinear material effects caused by progressive damage behavior are captured directly on the discretized material level using simple isotropic continuum damage laws. In contrast to conventional FE2 methods which use the Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve both scales numerically, the fine scale problem (material level) is rewritten in an integral form of Lippmann–Schwinger type and solved efficiently using the fast Fourier transformation (FFT). The calculation is carried out on a regular voxel grid that can be obtained from 3D images like tomographies. The fine scale problem is integrated in a standard Finite Element framework which is used to solve the macroscopic BVP (component level). In the work at hand, the scale coupling technique and the computation of the macroscopic tangent are described, and in some numerical examples the convergence behavior of the macroscopic Newton algorithm is investigated. Thereby the simulations were considered until localization and softening on the material scale occurred. It is shown that the proposed method presents an effective way to determine the exact physical macroscopic response considering arbitrary microstructures and loading conditions.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, a comprehensive approach to the modelling of composite materials witha microstructure exhibiting various types of disorder is proposed. In particular, a fibrousgraphite-epoxy composites with fibers randomly distributed within a transverse plane sec-tion and plain weave fabric composites are addressed as representatives of such materialsystems. Two different modelling strategies are examined. The first one assumes a welldefined geometry of the microstructure arrangement and specific boundary conditions. Inthis framework, the complicated real microstructure is replaced by a substantially simplerperiodic unit cell, which statistically resembles the real microstructure in a suitable sense.Periodic distribution of such unit cells is explored and the finite element method is calledto carry out the numerical computation. The theoretical basis for the second approach arethe Hashin-Shtrikman variational principles. The random character of the fiber distribu-tion is incorporated directly into the variational formulation employing certain statisticaldescriptors.A number of statistical descriptors suitable for the microstructure characterizationof a random medium is examined first.  Several methods for their determination areproposed and tested for a simple theoretical model of a microstructure.  Additionally,a validity of various statistical hypotheses usually accepted for a random heterogenousmedium is checked for the real microstructure represented here by the graphite fiber towembedded into the polymer matrix. Next, a stochastic optimization algorithm based onefficient combination of genetic algorithm essentials with basic concepts of the simulatedannealing method is introduced.Suitable optimization procedure formulated in terms of the selected statistical de-scriptors is proposed to derive the desired unit cell. Several numerical experiments areperformed to demonstrate the applicability of the selected optimization method to thiscomplicated optimization problem. A number of numerical studies is performed to quan-tify individual unit cells. The objective is to identify a number of particles required forspecific problems to provide a sufficiently accurate representation of the behavior of realcomposites. A standard problem of deriving the effective mechanical properties is con-sidered first. A general approach permitting either strain or stress control is pursued. Itis observed that the unit cell consisting of five fibers only provides reasonably accurateestimates of the macroscopic properties. Similar conclusions apply to the thermal, linearand non-linear viscoelastic problems considered next.In certain applications the finite element approach used with the unit cell analysis mayprove to be unnecessary expensive. In such a case, one may appreciate well-known effec-tive medium theories where applicable. Here, the most widely used variational principlesof Hashin and Shtrikman extended to account for the presence of various transformationfields defined as local eigenstrain or eigenstress distributions in the phases are revisited. Random character of fibers arrangement is described here by the two-point probabil-ity function. When used with the Hashin-Shtrikman variational principles this functionprovides sufficient information for obtaining bounds or estimates on the effective materialproperties of real composites with statistically homogeneous microstructures. The Fouriertransform-based approach is successfully implemented when solving the resulting equa-tions. An extensive comparison with the finite element-based methodology is presentedto investigate the applicability and limitations of this modelling strategy.The extension of principles proposed for the determination of statistically optimizedperiodic unit cell to the modelling of plain-weave composites is proposed.  Again, theparameters of the idealized periodic unit cell are found by matching appropriate statis-tical descriptors related to the target microstructure and two-dimensional cross-sectionof the geometry model. In particular, the ability to incorporate a longitudinal shift ofindividual layers of the composite system into the model of the periodic unit cell is exam-ined. Geometrical parameters derived from the optimization procedure are then used togenerate an equivalent periodic unit cell, which is then combined with the finite elementmethod analysis to provide the desired effective material properties. Finally, an exampleof application of Hashin-Shtrikman based homogenization to study the prestress effectson failure behavior of a braided weave composite system is presented.},

In our work, a crystal plasticity (CP) based framework is developed to identify the critical porosity characteristics, which quantifies the limiting scenarios of fatigue crack initiation at a pore rather than the crystallographic features. 3D virtual microstructures are developed based on the characterization of SLM IN718 for use in the CP simulations. Damage indicator parameters, such as the plastic strain accumulation, elastic stress anisotropy, resolved shear stress and triaxiality, obtained from the CP simulations are used to identify the most probable locations of crack initiation. Pores are explicitly added to the microstructure instantiations in a systematic manner by varying the size, location, and proximity between pores. The critical pore size is defined as the size beyond which the location of crack nucleation transitions from crystallographic features to the pore vicinity, which is determined to be 20 μm in the material of interest with an average grain size of 48 μm. This work is beneficial in qualifying SLM materials given the natural porosity inherent to the manufacturing process, by reducing the number of fatigue experiments.},

The results show that PSBs cannot transfer through all types of large-angle GBs, regardless of their orientation with respect to the stress axis. Secondary slip was often observed near the GBs, leading to strain incompatibility. When the slip systems of the two adjacent crystals are coplanar, the transmission of a PSB across a GB strongly depends on the slip directions of the two adjacent crystals. It was found that only the low-angle GBs can be passed through by PSBs, and accordingly they are insensitive to intergranular fatigue cracking. For a special copper bicrystal with coplanar slip systems, the ladderlike dislocation arrangements within the adjacent PSBs become discontinuous and a dislocation-affected-zone appears near the GB due to the difference in the slip direction of the two adjacent crystals. Therefore, the necessary conditions for the transmission of a PSB across a GB are that the neighboring grains have a coplanar slip system and identical slip directions.},

Metals deforming plastically through dislocation motion are of this class and form the primary application of the theory. The development is in terms of a general internal-variable thermodynamic formalism for description of the microstructural rearrangements, and it is shown how metal plasticity may be so characterized. The principal result is in the normality structure which is shown to arise in macroscopic constitutive laws when each of the local microstructural rearrangements proceeds at a rate governed by its associated thermodynamic force. This provides a theoretical framework for time-dependent inelastic behavior in terms of a “flow potential”, and reduces to statements on normality of strain increments to yield surfaces in the time-independent case. Conventional characterizations of the stress-state dependence of metallic slip are noted to be in accord with this concept of associated forces governing rates, so that the resulting normality structure may be considered directly applicable to metal plasticity.},

	abstract = {A study of steady creep of face centred cubic (f. c. c.) and ionic polycrystals as it relates to single crystal creep behaviour is made by using an upper bound technique and a self-consistent method. Creep on a crystallographic slip system is assumed to occur in proportion to the resolved shear stress to a power. For the identical systems of an f. c. c. crystal the slip-rate on any system is taken as γ = α(ז/ז0)n where α is a reference strain-rate, ז is the resolved shear stress and ז0 is the reference shear stress. The tensile behaviour of a polycrystal of randomly orientated single crystals can be expressed as ∊̄ = α(σ̄/σ̄0)n where ∊̄ are σ̄ the overall uniaxial strain-rate and stress and σ̄0 is the uniaxial reference stress. The central result for an f. c. c. polycrystal in tension can be expressed as σ̄0 = h(n) ז0. Calculated bounds to h(n) coincide at one extreme (n = ∞) with the Taylor result for rigid/perfectly plastic behaviour and at the other (n = 1) with the Voigt bound for linear viscoelastic behaviour. The self-consistent results, which are shown to be highly accurate for n = 1, agree closely with the upper bound for n ≽ 3. Two types of glide systems are considered for ionic crystals: A-systems, \{110\} {\textless}110{\textgreater}, with γ = α(ז/זA)n; and B-systems, \{100\} {\textless}110{\textgreater}, with γ = α(ז/זB)n. The upper bound to the tensile reference stress σ̄0 is shown to have the simple form σ̄0 ≼ A(n)זA+B(n)זB; A(n) and B(n) are computed for the entire range of n, including the limit n = ∞. Self-consistent predictions are again in good agreement with the bounds for high n. Upper bounds in pure shear are also calculated for both f. c. c. and ionic polycrystals. These results, together with those for tension, provide a basis for assessing the most commonly used stress creep potentials. The simplest potential based on the single effective stress invariant is found to give a reasonably accurate characterization of multiaxial stress dependence.},

Résumé
Nous avons analysé numériquement les déformations non uniformes de monocristaux dépendant de la vitesse, soumis à une traction. La géométrie du cristal est idéalisée en un modèle de double glissement plan. De plus, afin d'explorer les effets de la sensibilité à la vitesse du matériau, la formulation présente permet d'analyser une gamme de propriétés de durcissement et de geometries du cristal qui ne pourrait pas être analysée dans un contexte indépendant de la vitesse. Nous avons considéré deux geometries cristallines. La premiere est un modèle plan de cristal c.f.c. présentant un glissement symétrique primaire-conjugué. Pour cette géométrie, une comparaison directe avec un calcul antérieur indépendant de la vitesse montre que la sensibilité du matériau à la vitesse retarde notablement le développement des bandes de cisaillement Notre formulation dépendant de la vitesse permet également une exploration plus complète des effets de forts rapports de durcissement latent sur le développement d'un glissement “inégal”. En particulier, nous montrons qu'un fort durcissement latent et un glissement inégal peuvent produire des contraintes cinématiques qui empêchent les bandes de cisaillement de se propager entièrement à travers la section de l'éprouvette. La seconde géométrie modélise un cristal c.c. orienté de manière à ce qu'il y ait approximativement un mode double de glissement, les systèmes de glissement étant inclinés à plus de 45 degrés de l'axe de traction. Les calculs montrent la formation d'une bande localisée de glissement conjugué. Les rotations du réseau accompagnant ce mode conduisent éventuellement à une diminution de la contrainte de cisaillement réduite sur le système le plus actif dans la bande, de sorte que les bandes n'accumulent pas de grandes déformations et que de bandes de cisaillement catastrophique ne se forment pas. Nous discutons également les implications de la sensibilité à la vitesse du matériau pour la prévision des propriétés mécaniques des polycristaux.
Zusammenfassung
Die ungleichmäβige Verformung geschwindigkeitsabhängiger Einkristalle unter Zugbelastung wird numerisch analysiert. Die Kristallgeometrie wird in einem planaren Doppelgleitmodell idealisiert dargestellt. Die geschwindigkeitsabhängige Formulierung erlaubt -zusätzlich zur Untersuchung von Effekten durch die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit des Materials- die Analyse einer Reihe von Verfestigungseigenschaften und Kristallgeometrien, welche mit geschwindigkeitsunabhängigen Verfahren nicht behandelt werden können. Zwei Kristallgeometrien werden modelliert. Eine ist ein planares Modell für den kfz. Kristall, der sich in symmetrischer Gleitung im primären und im konjugierten System verformt. Bei dieser Geometrie zeigt ein Vergleich mit einer früheren geschwindigkeitsunabhängigen Rechnung, daβ die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit des Materials die Entwickling von Scherbändern beträchtlich verzögert. Die vorliegende geschwindigkeitsabhängige Formulierung ermöglicht auβerdem, die Effekte hoher latenter Verfestigung (d.h. gröβer als nach Taylor) auf das Auftreten ungleichmäβiger Gleitung zu untersuchen. Insbesondere zeigen wir, daβ hohe latente Verfestigung und ungleichmäβige Gleitprozesse zu kinematischen Einschränkungen führen können, die die Ausbreitung von Scherbändern durch den gesamten Probenquerschnitt verhindern. Das zweite Modell beschreibt einen krz. Kristall, der so orientiert ist, daβ annähernd Doppeigleitung auf Gleitsystemen mit mehr als 45° Neigungswinkel zur Zugachse auftritt. Die Rechnung ergibt die Bildung eines lokalisierten Bandes von konjugierter Gleitung. Die mit diesem Gleitprozeβ zusammenhängenden Gitterrotationen führen schlieβlich zu einem Abfall der Flieβspannung in dem im Band aktiveren System. Daher können Bänder keine groβen Abgleitungen akkumulieren; katastrophenartige Scherbänder treten also nicht auf. Auβerdem wird die Bedeutung der Geschwindig-keitsempfindlichkeit des Materials für die Voraussage der mechanischen Eigenschaften von Polykristallen aufgezeigt.},

The implications of material rate sensitivity for uniqueness are also discussed with reference to implications for the prediction of mechanical properties of polycrystals.
Résumé
Nous avons analysé numériquement les déformations non uniformes de monocristaux dépendant de la vitesse, soumis à une traction. La géométrie du cristal est idéalisée en un modèle de double glissement plan. De plus, afin d'explorer les effets de la sensibilité à la vitesse du matériau, la formulation présente permet d'analyser une gamme de propriétés de durcissement et de geometries du cristal qui ne pourrait pas être analysée dans un contexte indépendant de la vitesse. Nous avons considéré deux geometries cristallines. La premiere est un modèle plan de cristal c.f.c. présentant un glissement symétrique primaire-conjugué. Pour cette géométrie, une comparaison directe avec un calcul antérieur indépendant de la vitesse montre que la sensibilité du matériau à la vitesse retarde notablement le développement des bandes de cisaillement Notre formulation dépendant de la vitesse permet également une exploration plus complète des effets de forts rapports de durcissement latent sur le développement d'un glissement “inégal”. En particulier, nous montrons qu'un fort durcissement latent et un glissement inégal peuvent produire des contraintes cinématiques qui empêchent les bandes de cisaillement de se propager entièrement à travers la section de l'éprouvette. La seconde géométrie modélise un cristal c.c. orienté de manière à ce qu'il y ait approximativement un mode double de glissement, les systèmes de glissement étant inclinés à plus de 45 degrés de l'axe de traction. Les calculs montrent la formation d'une bande localisée de glissement conjugué. Les rotations du réseau accompagnant ce mode conduisent éventuellement à une diminution de la contrainte de cisaillement réduite sur le système le plus actif dans la bande, de sorte que les bandes n'accumulent pas de grandes déformations et que de bandes de cisaillement catastrophique ne se forment pas. Nous discutons également les implications de la sensibilité à la vitesse du matériau pour la prévision des propriétés mécaniques des polycristaux.
Zusammenfassung
Die ungleichmäβige Verformung geschwindigkeitsabhängiger Einkristalle unter Zugbelastung wird numerisch analysiert. Die Kristallgeometrie wird in einem planaren Doppelgleitmodell idealisiert dargestellt. Die geschwindigkeitsabhängige Formulierung erlaubt -zusätzlich zur Untersuchung von Effekten durch die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit des Materials- die Analyse einer Reihe von Verfestigungseigenschaften und Kristallgeometrien, welche mit geschwindigkeitsunabhängigen Verfahren nicht behandelt werden können. Zwei Kristallgeometrien werden modelliert. Eine ist ein planares Modell für den kfz. Kristall, der sich in symmetrischer Gleitung im primären und im konjugierten System verformt. Bei dieser Geometrie zeigt ein Vergleich mit einer früheren geschwindigkeitsunabhängigen Rechnung, daβ die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit des Materials die Entwickling von Scherbändern beträchtlich verzögert. Die vorliegende geschwindigkeitsabhängige Formulierung ermöglicht auβerdem, die Effekte hoher latenter Verfestigung (d.h. gröβer als nach Taylor) auf das Auftreten ungleichmäβiger Gleitung zu untersuchen. Insbesondere zeigen wir, daβ hohe latente Verfestigung und ungleichmäβige Gleitprozesse zu kinematischen Einschränkungen führen können, die die Ausbreitung von Scherbändern durch den gesamten Probenquerschnitt verhindern. Das zweite Modell beschreibt einen krz. Kristall, der so orientiert ist, daβ annähernd Doppeigleitung auf Gleitsystemen mit mehr als 45° Neigungswinkel zur Zugachse auftritt. Die Rechnung ergibt die Bildung eines lokalisierten Bandes von konjugierter Gleitung. Die mit diesem Gleitprozeβ zusammenhängenden Gitterrotationen führen schlieβlich zu einem Abfall der Flieβspannung in dem im Band aktiveren System. Daher können Bänder keine groβen Abgleitungen akkumulieren; katastrophenartige Scherbänder treten also nicht auf. Auβerdem wird die Bedeutung der Geschwindig-keitsempfindlichkeit des Materials für die Voraussage der mechanischen Eigenschaften von Polykristallen aufgezeigt.},

ICE 884, “Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen” derailed at high speed (approx 200 km/h) and hit a viaduct that then collapsed on the train. The carriages that followed zigzagged like an accordion against the collapsed viaduct. The accident resulted in 101 dead and 88 injured. It sparked the greatest rescue operation undertaken to date in post-war Germany. This train had been synonymous with safety, reliability and progress. How could the accident have happened? At first glance, this accident was an unfortunate, and perhaps hardly foreseeable, failure of a part that unexpectedly proved to be very crucial. Yet, the case can very well be analysed as a situation that could have been prevented had the technology been better organized.},

Diese Erscheinung, wie die sprunghafte Dehnung überhaupt, beruht auf einer Schwierigkeit bei der Entstehung der ersten „lokalen Gleitung“; sie ähnelt den Keimbildungsschwierigkeiten bei Phasenübergängen, da das Eintreten geringster Gleitungen ein sich lawinenartig beschleunigendes Gleiten hervorruft. In einem Fall konnte der Kristall mehrere Minuten lang 30\% über seine (sonst gut reproduzierbare) Streckgrenze belastet werden, ohne daß Spuren bleibender Dehnung beobachtet werden konnten. Aus diesem und aus bereits bekanntem Versuchsmaterial werden Schlüsse gezogen über die Entstehung und Ausbreitung des Gleitvorganges sowie über das Verhältnis, in dem die makroskopische Abgleitung zu den physikalisch einheitlichen „elementaren“ Gleitvorgängen steht.

The measure of this strain, which will be represented by s, is the ration of the relative lateral movement of two parallel planes of slip to the distance between them. Thus it is defined in the same way as the shear strain considered in the theory of elasticity.},

The experiments reveal there is a contact size effect in fretting fatigue life. Two critical plane models are used to predict the observed experimental lives. The results show that these models may provide over-conservative life estimates for fretting tests subjected to more rapidly varying contact stress fields. The existence of a critical stressed layer, or volume, is used to explain these results qualitatively, and averaging methods are then developed to allow the extension of the critical plane approach to cases of rapidly varying contact stress fields. It is shown that a critical averaging dimension of the order of the grain size of the material appears to give realistic estimates of fatigue life and predicts the observed size effect reported in the experimental work.},

	abstract = {Amongst a large number of fatigue criteria proposed for the prediction of crack initiation in thermo-mechanical fatigue, various approaches have been found to be particularly useful for certain categories of material over specific domains of temperature and cyclic strain. However, no particular approach appears to give invariably better predictions than others, so that the choice of the lifing model must be based on validation for the relevant circumstances. In this paper, the focus is placed on the energy dissipation criterion (EDC). We present physical arguments in favour of this approach’s versatility, and illustrate its performance by the application of this approach both in the macroscopic and micromechanical context. Firstly, by way of illustration we consider cyclic deformation of a Ramberg–Osgood material, with a view to establish the equivalence between the EDC and some selected classical criteria. For this simple but analytically tractable case several interesting results can be established, including the equivalence between EDC and both stress range and strain range lifing criteria. Secondly, we consider fatigue loading of polycrystalline FCC material deforming by the combination of anisotropic linear elasticity and crystal slip. Energy dissipation density in this case is location-dependent even for a polycrystal subjected to macroscopically uniform stress and strain. Crack initiation then is predicted to occur at the ‘weakest link’ location corresponding to the most intense dissipation. The above two versions of energy dissipation criteria are each compared against experimental data. The comparative performance of Walker strain, Smith–Watson–Topper (SWT) and EDC lifing methods is assessed. It is concluded that EDC provides improved reliability, particularly for cases of complex loading paths and mechanisms interactions.},

	abstract = {Modeling the strengthening effect of grain boundaries (Hall–Petch effect) in metallic polycrystals in a physically consistent way, and without invoking arbitrary length scales, is a long-standing, unsolved problem. A two-scale method to treat predictively the interactions of large numbers of dislocations with grain boundaries has been developed, implemented, and tested. At the first scale, a standard grain-scale simulation (GSS) based on a finite element (FE) formulation makes use of recently proposed dislocation-density-based single-crystal constitutive equations (“SCCE-D”) to determine local stresses, strains, and slip magnitudes. At the second scale, a novel meso-scale simulation (MSS) redistributes the mobile part of the dislocation density within grains consistent with the plastic strain, computes the associated inter-dislocation back stress, and enforces local slip transmission criteria at grain boundaries. Compared with a standard crystal plasticity finite element (FE) model (CP-FEM), the two-scale model required only 5\% more CPU time, making it suitable for practical material design. The model confers new capabilities as follows: (1)The two-scale method reproduced the dislocation densities predicted by analytical solutions of single pile-ups.(2)Two-scale simulations of 2D and 3D arrays of regular grains predicted Hall–Petch slopes for iron of 1.2±0.3MN/m3/2 and 1.5±0.3MN/m3/2, in agreement with a measured slope of 0.9±0.1MN/m3/2.(3)The tensile stress–strain response of coarse-grained Fe multi-crystals (9–39 grains) was predicted 2–4 times more accurately by the two-scale model as compared with CP-FEM or Taylor-type texture models.(4)The lattice curvature of a deformed Fe-3\% Si columnar multi-crystal was predicted and measured. The measured maximum lattice curvature near grain boundaries agreed with model predictions within the experimental scatter.},

	abstract = {When a sample is cyclically loaded under a mean stress or strain, incremental strain ratcheting or mean stress relaxation phenomena are usually observed. Experiments show that for metallic materials there is generally no full mean stress relaxation as well as saturation of macroscopic strain ratcheting. In contrast, most macroscopic constitutive models produce both quantities in excess, and complex sets of additional internal variables must be introduced to improve the modeling. Little attention has been paid to model such phenomena using polycrystal aggregates especially going up to the regime of cyclic mechanical stability. In this work based on an elementary crystal plasticity model for FCC crystals and large scale finite element simulations, it is shown that the interaction between different grains is sufficient to cater for such complex phenomena. Light is shed on how different regions of the polycrystal accommodate each other and how the classical definition of constant rate strain ratcheting or a zero mean stress is nearly impossible to apply to a polycrystalline aggregate. In addition, it is shown that even if a macroscopic stable hysteresis stress strain loop is observed, ratcheting phenomena can still be observed at the local scale. The distributions of different constitutive quantities within a polycrystal are also analyzed which gives a new insight into what is happening inside a polycrystal in terms of stress and strain redistribution. In particular, the existence of evolving bimodal distributions of stress and accumulated plastic strain is evidenced and related to the occurrence of plastic shakedown and incomplete mean stress relaxation. Two numerical criteria to detect strain ratcheting are finally proposed and discussed.},

The field of interest of the model concerns monotomic and cyclic multiaxial loadings, with the assumption of small perturbation. First we discuss the type of physical variables that have to be introduced on a microscale. The case of FCC metals is especially investigated, so that the localization process includes the evaluation of stresses and strains for each grain and each octahedral slip system. The stress-strain relations are written on a microscale for each slip system. All the elementary contributions are then summed up to obtain the macroscopic strain rate. Two types of applications are shown. One deals with the representation of yield surfaces for a 2024 aluminium alloy tested at room temperature. A good agreement is found between numerical simulations and experiments for the initial and the subsequent surfaces after tension-torsion loading paths. The second identification is made on a 316L stainless steel, also tested in tension-torsion at room temperature. For this last case, the model is able to account for the memory effect and the supplementary hardening related with the non-proportionality of the loading path.},

We propose an alternate method based on Fourier series which avoids meshing and which makes direct use of microstructure images. It is based on the exact expression of the Green function of a linear elastic and homogeneous comparison material. First, the case of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative procedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally arises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents by a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed by varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures. The flexibility of the method allows it to serve for a large variety of microstructures.},

Today's electronics, space, medical, transportation, and other industries are enriched by development, design and deployment of composite, heterogeneous and multifunctional materials. As a result, materials innovation is now considerably outpaced by other aspects from component design to product cycle. In this article, we review predictive nonlinear theories for multiscale modeling of heterogeneous materials. Deeper attention is given to multiscale modeling in space and to computational homogenization in addressing challenging materials science questions. Moreover, we discuss a state-of-the-art platform in predictive image-based, multiscale modeling with co-designed simulations and experiments that executes on the world's largest supercomputers. Such a modeling framework consists of experimental tools, computational methods, and digital data strategies. Once fully completed, this collaborative and interdisciplinary framework can be the basis of Virtual Materials Testing standards and aids in the development of new material formulations. Moreover, it will decrease the time to market of innovative products.},

Therefore, kinematic hardening formulations on the slip system level are of crucial importance due to their fundamental relevance in cyclic material modelling. The focus of this study is the comparison of three different kinematic hardening models (Armstrong Frederick, Chaboche, and Ohno\&ndash;Wang). In this work, investigations are performed on the modelling and prediction of the cyclic stress-strain behavior of the martensitic high-strength steel SAE 4150 for two different total strain ratios (R     \&epsilon;     = \&minus;1 and R     \&epsilon;     = 0). In the first step, a three-dimensional martensitic microstructure model is developed by using multiscale Voronoi tessellations. Based on this martensitic representative volume element, micromechanical simulations are performed by a crystal plasticity finite element model. For the constitutive model calibration, a new multi-objective calibration procedure incorporating a sensitivity analysis as well as an evolutionary algorithm is presented. The numerical results of different kinematic hardening models are compared to experimental data with respect to the appropriate modelling of the Bauschinger effect and the mean stress relaxation behavior at R     \&epsilon;     = 0. It is concluded that the Ohno\&ndash;Wang model is superior to the Armstrong Frederick and Chaboche kinematic hardening model at R     \&epsilon;     = \&minus;1 as well as at R     \&epsilon;     = 0.},

	abstract = {A microstructure-based model that accounts for the effect of grain size has been developed to study the effect of grain size on the fatigue life of Inconel 718 alloys. The fatigue behavior of two alloys with different grain size was determined by means of uniaxial cyclic deformation tests under fully-reversed deformation (Rε=-1) at 400 °C in the low cycle fatigue regime. The model was based in the determination of the fatigue indicator parameter (based on the local crystallographic strain energy dissipated per cycle) by means of computational homogenization of a representative volume element of the microstructure. The mechanical response of the single crystal within the polycrystal was modelled through a phenomenological crystal plasticity model which was modified to account for the effect of grain size on the monotonic and cyclic hardening/softening mechanisms. The microstructure-based crack initiation model parameters were calibrated from the experimental tests of the material with fine grain size. The results of the fatigue simulations were in good agreement with the experimental results in terms of the cyclic stress-strain curves and of the number of cycles for fatigue crack initiation. The model did not show any grain size effect on the fatigue life for the largest cyclic strain ranges while the predicted fatigue life predicted was considerably longer in the case of the microstructure with fine grain size for the lowest strain ranges, in quantitative agreement with experimental data. These differences were attributed to changes in the deformation modes between homogeneous plastic deformation at large cyclic strain ranges and localized plasticity in a few grains at low cyclic strain ranges.},

In addition, the same loadings were applied on the normalized solid specimens to investigate the effect of specimen geometry on multiaxial fatigue life. Similar fatigue life variation as a function of hardness was found for in-phase and out-of-phase loadings, with higher ductility beneficial in low-cycle fatigue (LCF) and higher strength beneficial in high-cycle fatigue (HCF). Multiaxial fatigue data were satisfactorily correlated for all hardness levels with the Fatemi?Socie parameter. Furthermore, in order to predict multiaxial fatigue life of steels in the absence of any fatigue data, the Roessle?Fatemi hardness method was used. Multiaxial fatigue lives were predicted fairly accurately using the Fatemi?Socie multiaxial model based on only the hardness level of the material. The applicability of the prediction method based on hardness was also examined for Inconel 718 and a stainless steel under a wide range of loading conditions. The great majority of the observed fatigue lives were found to be in good agreement with predicted lives.},

The present theoretical calculation, by taking the anisotropic characteristic of crystallographic symmetry and different choices of critical shear strength into account, results in a reasonable limit in grain size for applying dislocation pile-up theory to nanocrystalline materials. The deviation from the Hall—Petch relationship is rationalized in terms of a small number dislocation pile-up mechanism. A composite model is proposed to evaluate the strength of nanocrystalline materials. It is shown that this model can be used for interpreting the various cases observed in Hall—Petch studies. An analytical expression for assessing the creep rate of nanocrystalline materials by a diffusion mechanism, including triple line diffusion, is derived. It is predicted that the creep rate due to triple line diffusion will exhibit a stronger grain size dependence than that due to grain boundary diffusion.},

	abstract = {Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FIPs) serve as surrogate measures of the driving force to form and grow transgranular fatigue cracks in metals and alloys. FIPs are volume averaged over sub-grain regions using a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) model of polycrystalline microstructures. Questions naturally arise regarding the ability to computationally simulate a sufficient volume of microstructure samples to objectively build a converged estimate of the distribution of maximum FIPs above some threshold, referred to as an Extreme Value Distribution (EVD). A reliable EVD can be estimated by considering FIPs computed from samples comprised of a sufficient number of grains. A recently developed statistical technique is exploited in this work to predict the maximum FIPs in a large volume of duplex Ti-6Al-4V. Effects of several crucial algorithmic parameters in the CPFEM simulations are explored, including the sub-grain FIP averaging volume, the statistical volume element (SVE) size of each microstructure instantiation, number of SVEs necessary to project extreme value FIPs for larger volumes, and finite element mesh density. The SVE size defines the number of grains in a single simulation and therefore controls the number of nearest and second nearest neighbor grain interactions that dominate FIP EVDs. This interplays closely with the number of SVEs needed to establish reliable estimates of FIP EVDs for larger volumes of microstructure. We demonstrate that the number of grains sampled is a critical consideration in these types of CPFEM simulations aimed at EVDs. The statistical technique for estimation of EVD FIPs is relatively insensitive to both the SVE size and mesh density of a single simulation, provided a sufficient number of individual grains are sampled to capture dominant effects of microstructure heterogeneity. Furthermore, averaging FIPs over different sub-grain volumes results in consistent predictions of the maximum FIPs.},

Low-cycle fatigue experiments under strain-controlled conditions are conducted in order to calibrate a crystal plasticity model and a J2 model including isotropic and kinematic hardening. A critical plane fatigue indicator parameter (FIP) based on the Tanaka-Mura model is then presented to evaluate the location and quantify the driving force for the formation of a crack. The FIP is averaged over several potential crack paths within each grain defined by the intersection between a given slip plane and the plane of the model thus accounting for both the lattice orientation and morphology of the grain. Several fatigue simulations at various stress amplitudes are conducted using a sub-modeling technique for the attribution of boundary conditions on the polycrystalline aggregate models including an elliptic defect. The influence of the microstructure attributes and stress level on the location and amplitude of the FIP are then quantified and discussed.},
