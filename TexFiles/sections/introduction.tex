	\section{Introduction}
A "perfectly resistant" material, which never fails or experiences damage, is the dream of every engineer selecting a material for their product.
Nevertheless, such material does not exist. Materials sooner or later will fail, depending on how well the material is suitable for its use case.
Materials experience mechanical damage due to static and cyclic load. The material failure can dramatically affect a component or an entire system.
In some cases, a failing material can suspend a system and thus further damage other components.
In some cases, the malfunction of the systems due to a failed material will lead to discomfort.
However, in the case of mobility, failure may have a more significant impact, as the derailment of Eschede in 1998. In this accident, multiple people were killed, and many injured \cite{brumsen_case_2011}. 
The accident's primary cause of the failure is owed to the tires, which originated with a fatigue crack in the material. Such a big accident arises from the interaction of several events and could have been prevented by better design tires. 
A material that is more resistant to cyclic stress could have been selected.
Therefore it is advantageous to know the material's behavior, which is expected to result under the load of the component's purpose.\\


Metallic materials have different crystallographic structures, which define their properties. 
Furthermore, an alloy consists of several phases. Such changes or transitions in the material represent potential points for fatigue crack initiation and may affect fatigue life.
In the case of cyclic loads, where small loads occur which are way smaller than the load limits of the material, implying the importance of the microstructure. The material's microstructure consists of many grains that differ by their crystallographic orientation or phase assignment. Under load, each of the grains is stressed differently, and deformations in the microstructure occur, damaging the material and lowering the lifetime, even though the load hardly influences o a macroscopic scale.\\ 


One way to investigate the material lifetime under cyclic load, by considering its microstructure, is the mesoscopic approach of the \gls{CP}-method, which allows simulating micromechanical behavior.
With the help of \glspl{fip} and corresponding critical values, damage in the microstructure for each of its phases can be determined. Together those describe the lifetime until a fatigue crack is initiated.\\

Previous investigations dealing with the fatigue of metal, using the effectiveness of the FIP method, mainly refer to single-phase microstructures. In such investigations, the choice of material parameters and the morphology of the microstructure are essential. 
However, this is not generally applicable to all metals. 
Metals can have several phases, i.e., they consist of regions to which different material properties can be assigned.\\

Metals, which have more than one phase, are the focus of this work.
This work aims to determine how different phases in the material affect crack initiation under cyclic loading.
For this purpose, a model is created, representing a part of the researched material. 
Material properties in such a model are assigned according to each phases' properties, determining the number of cycles until crack initiation for a particular volume ratio between two phases.
The change in two specifications determines the exact determination of how different phases affect each other.
Foremost, the volume fraction occupied by each phase is varied, and individually, the grain size is varied, taking into account the Hall Petch equation.
Changing these specifications should determine how two different phases influence each other and under which aspects a multiphase material is likely to fail earliest.
