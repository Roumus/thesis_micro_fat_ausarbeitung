	\subsection{Grainsize Influence} \label{sec:grain_size_study}
	
	The previous studies in \autoref{sec:volstudy_rnd} and \autoref{subsec:cluster_grains} are mainly concerned with the volume fraction and the distribution of the ferritic phase. Nonetheless, no effect by changing a grain size is considered in those studies. Therefore, in the next step, the influence of ferrite grain size on the lifetime of the two-phase material is analyzed.\\
	
	It is well known from Literature \cite{morris_jr_influence_2001} that a decrease in grain size results in an increase of the yield strength. On a view of single grains, this is due to limitations of dislocation pile up, which depends on the grain size  \cite{wang_effect_1995}. Thus a grain is stiffer and more energy is required to deform the grain plastically.\\
	
	The Hall-Petch equation is a well-known method to adjust the yield strength of the material depending on the grain size.
	In this work, the Hall-Petch equation is taken into account for adjusting the critical shear stress. Cruzado showed that this approach to the yield strength could also be applied to crystal plasticity \cite{cruzado_crystal_2018}.
	In the context of this study, using the Hall-Petch equation as
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:Hall_Petch}
	\tau_{crit,d} = \tau_{0} + \frac{k}{\sqrt{d}} 
	\end{equation}
	
	where $\tau_{crit,d}$ is the critical shear stress for the specific grain size $d$. The influence of a change in grain size is considered by the Hall-Petch value $k$. $k$ is a material-specific value. Depending on the phase type, carbon content, and other aspects, $k$ can be approximated \cite{lim_simulation_2011}. $\tau_{0}$ is an initial reference value for the grain size dependent shear stress.\\
	
	Now, to represent this grain size effect in the crystal plasticity model, the flow law is extended, and the critical shear stress is described as a function of grain size. (\autoref{eq:shear_rate_system}).
	In the flow rule, there are two aspects, which could be varied depending on the grain size.
	Once the critical shear stress $\tau_{crit}$, which describes the stress required to cause plastic flow.
	Second is the back stress $\chi$, which affects kinematic hardening processes. 
	The critical shear stress is a value that can be initially given to the material and is therefore easily adjustable. 
	This study only investigates the grain size effect via the initially set critical shear stress. The change in back stress is not taken into account.
	For further investigations concerning the grain size and how kinematic hardening depending on grain size could be modeled, please refer to the work of Cruzado \cite{cruzado_crystal_2018}.\\
	
	In the scope of this study, only a change in the ferritic grain size is analyzed. The grain size of the martensitic phase is constant, and therefore no change in the martensitic material parameters is analyzed.
	Referring to the EBSD in \autoref{fig:EBSD}, the ferritic grain size is determined. 
	A mean equivalent circle diameter of $8.4 \mu m$ is determined from the area distribution, henceforth called the reference grain size.
	The current critical shear stress of $\tau_{crit} = 160$ MPa is assigned to this reference grain size (see \autoref{tab:matparams}).
	The Hall-Petch parameter is determined according to the literature \cite{lim_simulation_2011}. Thus $k=0.88$ is obtained, based on the properties of the ferritic phase.
	
	Thus, the grain size dependence of the initial yield strength $\tau_{0}$ can be calculated as $\tau_{0} = 160 MPa - \frac{0.88}{\sqrt{0.0000084}} \approx -142.972$.
	
	\autoref{plt:mod_crit_shear} visualizes the critical shear stress depending on the grain size. An exponential course of the critical shear stress arises.
	In the case of the maximum grain size, of approximately $20.3\mu m$, $\tau_{crit,d}$ is reduced to one-third of the reference value ($52.7 MPa$).
	On the other hand, in the case of the minimum grain size, of $3.3\mu m$, $\tau_{crit,d}$ is doubled ($335.3 MPa$).\\

	Based on this equation, extended simulation models are generated depending on the grain size of the ferritic phase in the microstructure model.
	The details are summarized below.\\
	The grain size in the model is indirectly specified by the number of grains and volume distribution. 
	In order to avoid a volume-dependent effect, the volume fraction of the ferritic phase remains constant at 10\%.
	With a length of $64 \mu m$ of the microstructure models, the available volume for the ferritic phase is $2.62*10^{-14} m^{3}$. 
	In order to determine the ferritic grain size in the model, this volume is distributed evenly among the ferritic grains. \\ 
	Assuming that the shape of the ferritic grain is a sphere, the grain size in the model can be determined from its volume.
	By this assumption, the ferritic grain numbers are specified so that grain size results in the range of the actual occurring grain diameters (according to the EBSD).
	Thereby two points were taken into account. First, the conversions must result in a grain number as a natural number $\mathbb{N}$.
	On the other hand, it should be possible to depicture the grains sufficient. This issue leads to a conflict in selecting the minimum grain size. The minimum grain size is not being sufficiently mapped in the coarse meshing used in the volume studies. Consequently, the resolution in this investigation is twice as large as for the volume study, i.e., 128 cells per spatial direction. 
	By those aspects, for the smallest grain size, a diameter of  $\approx 4.2 \mu m$ is set, which corresponds to 688 grains and  $\tau_{crit,d}= 287.7$. For the biggest grain size, a diameter of $\approx 20.2\mu m$ is set, which resembles 6 grains and  $\tau_{crit,d}= 52.4$. 
	Both values lie inside the range of the \gls{ebsd} measurements and differentiate strong from the reference value.
	Thus the parameters for the ferritic phase are determined. For the martensitic phase, parameters of the 37HRC martensite are assigned since this is the phase composition of interest intended for this work.	\\ Examples for the generated microstructures with minimum and maximum grain sizes are shown in \autoref{fig:gr_examp_6_688}. Those examples show the evenly distributed ferritic grains; the phase fractions are subdivided by multiple grains.  \\

	Five realizations are created for each microstructure model, and the following results represent the resulting mean lifetime of those five realizations.
	Again the microstructures are loaded strain- and stress-controlled.
	At strain-controlled load, the strain amplitudes are 0.3\%, 0.6\%, and 0.9\%. 
	At stress-controlled load, the stress amplitudes are $500$, $700$, and $900$ MPa.
	The load is applied over three cycles with a pure alternating strain ($R_{\varepsilon}=-1$). \\
	
	The resulting lifetimes for a ferritic grain size of $4.3$, $8.4$, and $20,3 \mu m$ are shown in Figure \ref{subplt:kg_mart_wohler}. In this figure, the applied loads are plotted over the resulting lifetime, based on the style of a Woehler diagram.\\
	
	First, let us focus on the lifetime results for the entire two-phase microstructure (Figure \ref{subplt:kg_whole_Wohler} and \ref{subplt:kg_whole_Wohler_strctr}). The shortest lifetime is plotted regardless of the phase. 
	Figure \ref{subplt:kg_whole_Wohler} and \ref{subplt:kg_whole_Wohler_strctr} show that the grain size drastically influences the lifetime. 
	Lifetime improves with decreasing ferritic grain size. Compared to the reference grain size, the lifetime of the smallest investigated grain size is 25\% to 108\% higher.   
	On the other side, the lifetime of the $20.3 \mu m$ grains is 45\% to 62\% shorter than the reference.\\
	
	
	It is particularly interesting that the crack initiation changes from the ferritic phase to the martensitic phase for most microstructures with small ferritic grain sizes.
	The classification is not entirely clear for large strain amplitudes and small ferritic grain sizes. Crack initiation occurs in either of the phases but is primarily found in the martensitic phase. \\
	
	As already mentioned, for the largest considered ferritic grain size of $20.3 \mu m$, the lifetime of the microstructure decreases. 
	Thus, crack initiation relies primarily on the ferritic phase at all load amplitudes.
	
	The grain size change affects either phase; due to this, the lifetime of each phase is plotted separately in \autoref{subplt:kg_whole_Wohler}.
	Investigating only the ferritic phase, the dependency on the grain size is directly visible. Compared to the reference, the lifetime is at least 123\% increased with decreasing grain size. At low strains, the smaller grains improve the lifetime up to 12249\%. Whereas with increasing grain size, the lifetime for the ferritic phase decrease by 13\% in consideration of the reference grain size.
	
	A change of the ferritic grain size affects apart from the lifetime of the ferritic phase also the martensitic phase's lifetime. 
	Figure \ref{subplt:kg_mart_Wohler} and \ref{subplt:kg_mart_Wohler_strctr} consider the lifetime of the martensitic phase.
	The change of the ferritic grain size influences the lifetime of the martensitic phase depending on the type of loading.
	Under strain-controlled loading, the lifetime of the martensitic phase is lowest in the microstructures with the ferrite at reference grain size. 
	The martensitic phase under stress-controlled load shows similar behavior as the ferritic phase. At high stress, the decrease of the ferritic grain size increases the lifetime of the martensitic phase and vice versa. 
	Nevertheless, the big grains do not affect the martensitic lifetime at low stress. Thus, the crack initiation shifts mainly to the ferritic phase.
	Small grains at low stress improve the martensitic lifetime, but comparatively with a much lower rate, so in this case, crack initiation is mainly found in the martensitic phase.  \\

	Figure \ref{fig:mics_stresses_KnGr_6_dependent}, \ref{fig:mics_stresses_KnGr_85_dependent}, and \ref{fig:mics_stresses_KnGr_688_dependent} are visualizations of microstructures with different ferritic grain size under the same load.
	Those figures visualize how local stresses at high strain distribute in the microstructure. 
	In comparison of Figure \ref{fig:mics_stresses_KnGr_6_dependent} with Figure \ref{fig:mics_stresses_KnGr_85_dependent} the magnitudes of the stresses are similar, though they are differently distributed.
	With big grains, the stresses are more spread. The martensitic phase is uniformly stressed. 
	Against this, stresses gather at ferritic grains and are less distributed at the reference grain size. 
	With even smaller grains, this observation is even more dominant. The small ferritic grains are mainly stressed. Thereby significantly higher local stresses occur compared to the other grain sizes (see Figure \ref{fig:mics_stresses_KnGr_688_dependent}).
	
	
	Furthermore, examine \autoref{plt:KnGr_strain_and_phase_split}, which plots the lifetime depending on the ferritic grain size for either phase.
	The lifetime of the martensitic phase fluctuates with a change in the ferritic grain size but stays compared to the ferritic phase in a close range. Against this, the ferritic phase's lifetime follows the exponential course of the changed critical shear stress.
	
	To recap the grain size study, concluding that the lifetime of the metal is reduced with increasing ferritic grain size and raised with decreasing ferritic grain size. This effect also affects the point of crack initiation and may shift the probability of crack initiation entirely to one phase.
