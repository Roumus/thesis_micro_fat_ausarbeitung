abstract = {High cycle fatigue (HCF) life in cast Al–Mg–Si alloys is particularly sensitive to the combination of microstructural inclusions and stress concentrations. Inclusions can range from large-scale shrinkage porosity with a tortuous surface profile to entrapped oxides introduced during the pour. When shrinkage porosity is controlled, the relevant microstructural initiation sites are often the larger Si particles within eutectic regions. In this paper, a HCF model is introduced which recognizes multiple inclusion severity scales for crack formation. The model addresses the role of constrained microplasticity around debonded particles or shrinkage pores in forming and growing microstructurally small fatigue cracks and is based on the cyclic crack tip displacement rather than linear elastic fracture mechanics stress intensity factor. Conditions for transitioning to long crack fatigue crack growth behavior are introduced. The model is applied to a cast A356-T6 Al alloy over a range of inclusion severities.}
